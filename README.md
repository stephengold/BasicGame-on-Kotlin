# BasicGame-on-Kotlin

jMonkeyEngine's prototypical `BasicGame` as a Gradle/Kotlin project

If you want to get started using Kotlin with jMonkeyEngine's v3.7.0 SDK (or with
NetBeans 24 IDE) and don't know where to start, use this project as a template.

### Clone the BasicGame-on-Kotlin repository using Git:

 1. Open the "Clone Repository" wizard in the IDE, either:
     + Menu bar -> "Team" -> "Git" -> "Clone..." or
     + Menu bar -> "Team" -> "Remote" -> "Clone..."
 2. For "Repository URL:" specify
    "https://github.com/stephengold/BasicGame-on-Kotlin.git" (without the quotes).
 3. Clear the "User:" and "Password:" text boxes.
 4. For "Clone into:" specify a writable folder (on a local filesystem)
    that doesn't already contain "BasicGame-on-Kotlin".
 5. Click on the "Next >" button.
 6. Make sure the "master" remote branch is checked.
 7. Click on the "Next >" button again.
 8. Make sure the Checkout Branch is set to "master*".
 9. Make sure the "Scan for NetBeans Projects after Clone" box is checked.
10. Click on the "Finish" button.
11. When the "Clone Completed" dialog appears,
    click on the "Open Project" button.
12. When the "Open Project" dialog reports problems,
    click on the "Resolve Problems..." button.
13. When the "Resolve Project Problems" dialog appears, the only problem should be "Priming Build Required".
    Click on the "Resolve..." button.
14. When "This problem was resolved" appears in the dialog's text box,
    click on the "Close" button.

### Run the project

 1. In the "Projects" window of the IDE,
    right-click on the "BasicGame-on-Kotlin" project to select it.
